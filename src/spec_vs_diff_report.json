  "summary": "Core Valentine invitation UI appears to be implemented with a dedicated page/component, a dodging \"No\" button with cycling prompts, and a \"Yes\" success view that includes a fireworks overlay and celebratory text. However, the required generated image assets are not present in the diff, and several extra/unrequested additions (empty backend actor, footer branding, and auth/query hooks) were introduced. Some REQ-1/REQ-2 UI text/layout details cannot be fully verified because ValentineInvite.tsx is truncated before the heading/question/buttons markup.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the required generated images to the app as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and render them in the UI (no backend image serving).",
      "reason": "The UI references the required image paths, but the diff summary does not include the actual PNG files under frontend/public/assets/generated with the specified filenames.",

      "reason": "ValentineInvite.tsx is truncated before the name/question/buttons JSX, so the exact required strings and button labels cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Show a fixed-position prompt box under the name that cycles through the specified messages in order, looping after the last message back to the start of the loop.",
      "reason": "While the message list and click-count logic are present, the diff does not clearly show (due to truncation) that the prompt box is rendered in a fixed position under the name, and the loop behavior in the effect cannot be fully validated against the exact required looping sequence from the truncated context.",
